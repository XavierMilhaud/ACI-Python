# Actuarial Climate Index Package

   This is the initial repository for the package. Currently, the package is organized into different classes, with each class dedicated to a specific component required for the index calculation. Further optimization will be done later. The source files implementing these classes are located in the aci/ directory. The ActuarialClimateIndex.py file is used to calculate the index. Refer to the notebooks for detailed usage instructions.

Additionally, the project requires certain dependencies to compile correctly. It is recommended to create a virtual environment using conda for testing purposes. The environments.yml file facilitates this setup. 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Once the environment is created and activated, you can open the notebook files to test the code.

I have also included a Makefile that allows you to remove files generated by the code by running 

```bash
make clean
```
It is possible to run the current tests implemented by processing : 

```bash
make test
```
